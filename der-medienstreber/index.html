    <h1>Der Medienstreber</h1>
    <p>I started this project to help graphic design trainees prepare for their final exam. It's basically I long list of high quality ressources and information about the exam.</p>

        <h2>Project summary</h2>
        <p>My graphic design apprenticeship was coming to an end and with that the final exam was right around the corner. I created this small site as part of my preperation. It basically is just a long list of usefull links about the different exam topics. Be it a blog post, a handwritten fact sheet, a good book recommendation or just a wikipedia article. I got pretty much every topic covered with a few helpfull links.</p>
        <p>The project was accepted really well by everyone else doing an graphic design apprenticeship and got shared quite a lot on Facebook and Twitter. I guess I helped a few people with their exam and that is really something I'm proud of. Additionally I <a href="/blog/how-to-kickstart-new-website-get-traffic/" title="How to kickstart your website and get traffic">wrote an article</a> where I go more in depth about the success of the project and what I did to spread the word. After all I was able to get almost 5000 visitors in the first two weeks.</p>

        <h2>Design & Illustration</h2>
        <p>As always, I kept everything really simple and straight forward. Just a list with usefull links. No more, no less. "Medienstreber" can be roughly translated to design nerd. I thought it would be interesting to create a cute character to give everything a more polished and friendly look. So I asked <a href="http://lauradinslage.de" title="portfolio of Laura Dinslage">Laura Dinslage</a> (a fellow coworker) to help me out. I think she did a great job and I'm really happy how the illustration turned out.</p>
        <h2>Development & Tools</h2>
        <p>The last couple projects I was working on were built with Jekyll. This one is as well. I really like the fast loading speed and easy implementation static sites offer. I'm not really familiar with backend and server side development, so using a static site builder works great for me. Other than that it was a great practice trying out different approaches for creating the "pinterest effect". I tried things like <a href="http://masonry.desandro.com/" target="_blank" title="masonry grid">Masonry</a> and <a href="http://isotope.metafizzy.co/" target="_blank" title="Isotope grid">Isotope</a> but in the end I settled on a simple CSS only solution. The site is not using JS at all, which I guess is a great thing.</p><p><a href="http://medienstreber.de" title="website medienstreber.de">You can check out the final site over here.</a></p>
