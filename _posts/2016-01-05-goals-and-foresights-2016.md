2016 is going to be a really interesting and important year for me. Maybe even the most exciting year in my life so far. I do have a lot of plans for the next 12 months and although I know that not everything will turn out the way I was expecting it, I'm certain that the main outcome will be really positive. This is more like a personal write-down of my goals. I think it'll help me sticking to them so I can reflect on all of this the next year.

## Personal Life

I'm still living with my parents right now. After 22 years living in the same house and on the same street it's definitely time to move on and start living on my own. Till this year it was not possible to move out because my (not so well paying) apprenticeship is going till august 2016. And unfortunately there is no way moving out and living on such a small budget.

So I talked to my gorgeous girlfriend [Laura](http://lauradinslage.com) and we are moving in together. This whole project is going to really exciting for both of us and I hope we'll find a good apartment in Düsseldorf, Germany. Maybe you know someone who knows someone who is looking for two really nice tenants. [Just hit me up](mailto:hello@robinstickel.com).  

## Work and Education

As I mentioned above, my design apprenticeship is ending this august. I'm not sure what I'll do after that. The only thing I know is that I don't want to continue working at my old agency. My time at h1 communication was pretty good and I grew a lot. Both, personally and with my design skills. But the direction the company is leaning towards is not really what I want to be doing in the future. I'm really focused on online, mobile and everything digital. I want to work together with people who are sharing this mindset as well. 

In addition I'm still a really young designer and I know that I still need to learn a lot. Not only about design in general. I should (and will) improve and get better at public speaking, client management, coding, briefings and so on. 

There are a lot of great agencies in Düsseldorf, Cologne or North Rhine-Westphalia in general and I hope that I can find a nice team to continue working with. [Shoot me an email](mailto:robinstickel.com) if you thing I might be a good fit for your team.

Additionally I started a side business as freelance designer early this year. This is working out quite good so far. I already worked on a couple small projects and got some good experience through this. I hope to expand this business even further. Maybe I can be a fulltime freelancer some time in the future, we'll see.

## Side projects

I always liked to work on different side projects besides my normal work. Although I didn't have a lot of time beside my school projects and duties, I can make up some more time in the future. 

**Niche Websites**

I got really interested in niche websites and researched a lot on this topic. This also involves SEO and website optimization, which I think are really interesting thinks to work on. So I started [sanktmartin-lieder.de](http://sanktmartin-lieder.de/). It's all about a german festival called "Sankt Martin". You can compare it a bit to Halloween. Kids a walking from house to house, singing songs and collecting sweets. The site is not really set up and optimized yet, but it'll be by the end of this year. Maybe I can collect some beer money this way, we'll see. 

**Personal Reading List**

Additionally I set myself the goal to read one book a month. Inspired by the [reading list of Tobias van Schneider](http://www.vanschneider.com/reading/) I'm working on a similar small website where I collect, rate and showcase the books I've read. The code is not really working right now but I'll do my best. 

**Photography**

I bought myself a beginner DSLR last year and I enjoy shooting a lot. Right now it's more a hobby and it most likely will always be. Nevertheless did I do some birthday and event shootings for friends. I'll definitely continue doing this and build myself a website for my photography work.

## Conclusion 

2016 is going to be a really tough but exciting year. I set myself a lot of personal goals and I'm pretty confident that I'll be sticking to them. Let's see if I can make it, I'll reporting back by the end of the year ;)
