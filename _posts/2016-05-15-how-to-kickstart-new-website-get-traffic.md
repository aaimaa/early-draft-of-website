**The title is really catchy, I know. But hang on a bit and I’ll show you how my freshly released website got almost 3000 visitors, around 60 shares on Facebook and a few quality backlinks within it’s first week.**

## First things first (what this is all about)

My name is Robin Stickel and I’m a young UI/UX designer living and working in Düsseldorf, Germany. I’m doing a graphic design apprenticeship right now and the final exam takes place in less than three weeks ([that means I’m looking for an entry level position](mailto:hello@robinstickel.com)). To make it easier for me and my fellow students to prepare for it, I made a website where I collect all kinds of useful resources. Links, videos, slideshares, PDFs, lectures and so on…

To keep everything simple and easy to skim over, I only created a Pinterest like list with different topics. You can check out the site over here, its really simple and straight forward: [medienstreber.de](http://medienstreber.de)

Although the page is in German, you will be able to get the idea. It doesn’t matter for the upcoming trick anyway. It’ll work with every website. Let’s go:

## Contact important influencers and tell them about your website.

**That’s it? Yes. Is it worth it? Absolutely!**

There are two things people really love. The feeling of being important and the act of helping someone else. Especially on the internet.

So why don’t we combine these two and write an email to all kinds of people in our niche. Be it marketers, friends, competitors, journalists, bloggers, designers, grandmothers, companies or (as in my case) teachers.

Of course it’s not that easy. We need to follow a few steps and make sure to optimize our email and wording to get the most out of it.

## Where do I get the mail addresses from?

This part was quite easy for me (or at least with my niche). I made a website for graphic design students in Germany. So I asked myself “how can I get in contact with my target group? How can I reach out to them?”.

My idea was simple: Get in contact with teachers and schools and maybe they’ll share the website with their students. My assumption was that teachers would love to share quality resources and are maybe even willing to link back to my site. And because a normal school class in Germany consists of around 20–30 students, the potential audience was really big.

So I opened Google and searched for all kinds of schools and universities in Germany that teach graphic design (It’s called “Mediengestalter” in German). I found around 200 schools all around the country.
I then visited every single website and looked out for the teachers email addresses. After some hours (It took some time, school websites look like SHIT) I got almost 100 contacts from more than 60 different schools.

Can you do the same? Totally! You just have to think outside the box and get creative. Not only try to understand were your audience is, additionally think about the people your audience gets in contact with.

Let’s say you made a website where you sell dog food. Don’t try to get in contact with dog owners directly. Get emails from dog trainers, animal shelters, organizers of dog competitions, bloggers, dog magazines… It doesn’t really matter. As long as you reach out to people who would love to share your website. Of course your site has to be top notch for this to work, but let’s not talk about website optimization. ;-)

## What should I write?

Talk to them personally and make sure to call them by their name (double check the spelling). Treat them as if they are a good childhood friend. Don’t underestimate this. Getting connected and building a relationship with your audience is important. That way they feel like they owe you something and they are more likely to help you out (by sharing and linking your website).

Politely introduce yourself and say who you are and what you want. Then talk a bit about your new website and how people can benefit from it. After that ask them to do two small things for you. First, sharing your website with others. Second, ask them for feedback and if they can provide more input or resources (that was my case, but it can be almost everything). Just make it look like you value their expertise and work.

This will provide you with great feedback (and you should listen to it) and makes them feel important. And everyone likes to be important.

Keep it short, informative and friendly. Don’t write an in depth introduction about your new website. Instead try to boil down your project into the main advantages or selling points. Just 2 or 3 sentences, nobody wants to read more. And if they really want to, they’ll get back to you anyway.

## What to do now?

You play the waiting game. Some people will write you back, some will share the site on Facebook, some will set a backlink, some will talk about it with others and some won’t do anything.

But another thing I did was adding a sharing bar for social networks and building a mailing list with [hellobar](http://hellobar.com). These two had great impact, you can see the total stats below. You don’t have to do this and maybe it won’t be suitable for your project anyway. Just letting you know that this is also a great way to improve your total reach with almost zero work.

## The results

I can only talk about my own experience and the things that worked for me. Here are some stats about my site after the first two weeks. I didn’t advertise my project with other additional techniques. Writing emails to “important” people and influencers was the only thing I did.

* 3078 sessions after the first week, 4712 after two weeks (today)
* I got 3 backlinks which resulted in 84 unique visitors
* The site got shared 37 times on Facebook and 3 times on Twitter
* 57 people subscribed to the mailing list

I’m really happy how everything turned out. The hardest part was searching and collecting the email addresses and giving every email a personal touch. After all I spent like 3 hours and got rewarded with a nice amount of traffic.

Let me know if you have other tricks for sharing and kickstarting your new website. I would love to try them out. Additionally if you have further comments or know how I can improve my technique, [just get in touch.](http://twitter.com/@robinstickel)
