## Idea and Design

Working on your own website and on your own portfolio is probably the single hardest thing on earth. Especially if you are a graphic designer and wannabe front-end developer like I am. I started about two months ago. While designing and coding I saw so many cool portfolios by other designers that it was really hard not to get carried away.

My fable for simple design saved me quite a bit there and I tried to keep everything as minimal as possible. But either way I got inspired a lot by designers like [Sebastien Gabriel](http://sebastien-gabriel.com/), [Roy van Dijk](http://royvandijk.nl/), [Dejan Markovic](http://dejan-markovic.com/) or [Dustin Streek](http://www.dstnstrck.de/). Just to name a few.

So in the end I coded everything on my own and I’m really pleasured how everything turned out. Of course there are still some things I could tweak here and there, but overall the site looks pretty good right now. 

## Learning Jekyll and Git along the way

I am (and always have been) a do it yourself guy. Themes, Framework and Content Management Systems are great and I like to use them for smaller clients or niche websites. But building my own website with something prebuild was never an option for me. All these prebuild systems are great if you need to get some work done really quick or on a low budget. Of course neither of this is true for my personal website. I can now say in all honesty that my site is blazing fast and performing really well. This would not be the case with a prebuild theme. 

Because I’m just starting out as a front-end developer I tried to learn some new things on the way. One of my goals was to learn how to use a static site generator. I’ll have to build some static sites in the future and my portfolio was a good project to start with. After some research I settled on Jekyll. It was a bit confusing at first but after some time you really get used to it and you understand the great possibilities and advantages it offers. 

Another thing was Git and Github. I don’t have to code a lot on my current job and there was never a reason to use version control. But I really wanted to learn how to commit, push and deploy my code. Github (Pages) works really close together with Jekyll so I figured it would be the best to just learn Git along the way. And it turned out great! As with Jekyll I learned a lot about using version control and working with the terminal. 

## What’s up next

The site is definitely not finished yet. I want to include my photography and build a small reading list. It’s mostly inspired by [Tobias van Schneider](http://www.vanschneider.com/reading/). I'm working on a similar small website where I collect, rate and showcase the books I've read. This year I set myself the goal to read one book every month. It’s working out great so far, I’ve already read „[How To Win Friends And Influence People](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/1439199191/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1638&creative=19454&creativeASIN=1439199191&linkCode=as2&tag=robinstickel-21) by Dale Carnegie and „[The Richest Man in Babylon](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/0451205367/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1638&creative=19454&creativeASIN=0451205367&linkCode=as2&tag=robinstickel-21)“ by George S. Clason. If your haven’t read either one, you should really do it. But let’s not talk about books for now, more on that later. 

That’s it for now. Feel free to contact me on Twitter or shoot me a mail if you found any bugs or want to give me some feedback. I would be more than happy to hear what other internet people think about my site. Cheers.
